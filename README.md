SoundStreaming is an app that fetches music/tracks data using [soundcloud.com] (https://soundcloud.com/) API.

* Search music either by artist or song
* Over 120 million music/tracks from different artists
* Shuffle and repeat mode
* Play music/tracks on background
* Forward and backward jump during playback
* Download tracks that are authorized by their authors

## Used libraries:
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) and [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) libraries to manage Rest Client
* [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) library to bind views and avoid boilerplate views code
* [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) library to send data between components and makes code simpler
* [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) and [Circle ImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) libraries to manage images
* [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) library to make unit test and [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/) library to make UI test.

## Design pattern
MVP (Model View Presenter) pattern to keep it simple and make the code testable, robust and easier to maintain

## Build from the source:

In order to build the app you must provide your own API key from soundcloud.com.
Open local.properties file and paste your key instead of ***YOUR_API_KEY*** text in this line:
```
soundcloudapi="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
